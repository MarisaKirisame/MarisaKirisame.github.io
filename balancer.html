<ul>
    <li>Determine heap size for garbage collected runtime.</li>
    <li>Review the space time tradeoff - the bigger the heap size is the faster it run.</li>
    <li>Although all heap size for a single heap is pareto optimal, for a system with multiple heap it may not be.</li>
    <li>This reflect the age old insight that optimality of subcomponent does not imply optimality of the whole system.</li>
    <li>We introduce rule that gurantee global optimality.</li>
    <li>Under such rule, extra memory grow sublinearly (squareroot) w.r.t working memory, as opposed to linearly.</li>
    <li>Take memory away from big heap and give it to small heap, reflecting the law of marginal diminishing return.</li>
    <li>Recieve good result in v8 (the javascript compiler of chrome) and racket.
</ul>
